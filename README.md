# A fatigue-detection system based on the Eaidk310
- I made this project based on the Eaidk310, but all of the code is also able to be applied to Linux and Windows. 
- To use this system, you will have to firstly build a new folder called 'FatigueDetection' and put all of the original code and the cmakelist.txt into it.
- To run this system, you can use the 'face' directly. Of course, you can also compile them by yourself firstly.
- Before compiling them, you have to download the 'lbfmodel.yaml' by yourself.
- To compile this system, firstly run the 'cmake .' and then run the 'make' within the folder 'FatigueDetection'.
