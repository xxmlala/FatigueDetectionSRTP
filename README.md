# A fatigue-detection system based on the Eaidk310
0. I made this project based on the Eaidk310, but all of the code is also able to be applied to Linux and Windows. 
1. To use this system, you will have to firstly build a new folder called 'FatigueDetection' and put all of the original code and the cmakelist.txt into it.
2. To run this system, you can use the 'face' directly. Of course, you can also compile them by yourself firstly.
3. To compile this system, firstly run the 'cmake .' and then run the 'make' within the folder 'FatigueDetection'.
